# ProductRecommendationSystem
Built a product recommendation system that will help us suggest and recommend products to users looking to buy items based on the shopping attitudes of the other users.
## Product Recommendation System
Product recommender system by now are very common on e-commerce websites and this can be created using variety of techniques. It can be created by using data of users to give recommendations fit for that user, make content based recommendation, use data on users
browsing history or make general suggestions based on other users data i.e collaborative filtering.
Collaborating filtering is probably the most widely used algorithm for creating product recommender systems in online retailing. Collaborative Filtering is the process of filtering or evaluating items using the opinions of other people. It takes its roots from something humans have been doing for centuries - sharing opinions with others. Basically, collaborative filtering looks at each product and then scans the data from all customers to spot through a simple correlation score, to pin down the other products most correlated with the target, depending on whether they were purchased together in the same userâ€™s purchase.

## About Dataset 
In this project, I used an Online Retail dataset of H&M from the University of California, Irvine (UCI) Machine Learning Repository. This data set contains information of other users while shopping on a website which includes their order id, invoice number, price paid, quantity of items bought, description of the item and its stockcode. This information will help us suggest and recommend products to users looking to buy items based on the shopping attitudes of the other users.
